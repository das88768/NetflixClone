# NetflixClone
## Cloning Netflix website using HTML and CSS is a valuable learning experience as a learner:

- It allowed me to practice and reinforce my HTML and CSS skills by building the homepage of Netflix from scratch. I gained a deeper understanding of how these technologies work and how to apply them effectively.

- It also helped me understand the structure of a typical webpage. From this webpage, I learned the structure of the header, navigation menu, content area, and footer, which are common components of most websites.

- I gained experience in CSS styling and layout techniques, such as positioning elements, styling text, using CSS frameworks, and creating visually appealing designs.

- It also taught me how to handle images, including optimizing them for the web and using CSS to control their placement and appearance.

- During this learning process, I discovered how to use flexbox to assist in layout and styling, which greatly helped in structuring the components of the webpage.

- I also learned how to create a user form, including the use of buttons, radio buttons, and checkboxes.

- Additionally, some CSS styling techniques helped me understand more complex styling methods, such as linear gradients, transitions, and transforms.
